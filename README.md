This demonstrates that males are the prominent users of the bike sharing program. It also shows that the majority of the bikes checked out for 4.5 to 6.5 hours are done by males.

### Trips by Weekday per hour

The start and stop times for bike rentals on the weekdays are happening in early mornings and afternoons which coincide with the beginning and end of work hours of 9-5 PM. For weekends, bike rentals are heavier on saturdays but on both days the rentals are happening during the daytime hours.

Male subscribers are the highest users of the bike sharing program in New York

## Summary 
Based on the current data we have determined that males are the heaviest users of the bike sharing program. We can also see that subscribers are higher users than other customers. The numbers also show that the bike sharing program is successful within New York city. Based on the times of the bike renting, we can tell the majority of bike rentals are taking place before and after work so this could mean that bike's rented are potentially being used as a commute mechanism to get to and from work. To better understand if this business would be profitable in Des Moines, two other visualization and data analysis could be done with this dataset:
- Monthly analysis of bike usage to determine which months the bike sharing program is more heavily used to determine if it would be viable to keep the program going all year
- Ages of the bike users - this could help determine if the bikes are being used only by one age group or various and compare that to the age group range within Des Moines to see if it would match and there would be enough users within Des Moines to make the business profitable.
